		<description>Mr. Cunningham,

Greetings from Canada. Just a quick note to say that I very much enjoy your music.  Firebrandboy is on the top of my chillout playlist (and many others, for that matter). I Look forward to your future album releases!

ps.  Got a tad baked on some world-famous B.C. greenstuff, watched the sunset through the window...  listened to In the Warm Mad Night for the first time and it blasted my brains out through my ears. Thank you.</description>

		<description>I do have albums for sale but these are largely in digital format via the wonderful Bandcamp (http://firebrandboy.bandcamp.com). I do however have some remaining physical copies of my CD popNaive and my 7&quot; single Orange.

As far as gigs in Glasgow are concerned, I&#039;m actually living in Brighton now. So there&#039;s nothing planned for the foreseeable future but I wouldn&#039;t write of playing there if an opportunity arose. It&#039;d be great to be back in Scotland.

I&#039;ve also sent you an email. So please do let me know if you&#039;d be interested in obtaining physical copies of these albums/records. Be sure to keep an eye out for my next release, I hope you&#039;ll like it just as much!</description>
